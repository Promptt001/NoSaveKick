# NoSaveKick configuration
#
# This plugin works by:
#  1) Backing up the current on-disk playerdata/<uuid>.dat
#  2) Kicking the player (which causes the server to save)
#  3) Restoring (or deleting) the playerdata file after a short delay

rollback:
  # How long to wait after the kick before attempting to restore/delete the playerdata file.
  # 20 ticks = 1 second.
  delay-ticks: 5

  # Restore/delete runs asynchronously and may fail briefly if the server is still writing the file.
  # These settings control simple retry behavior.
  max-retries: 5
  retry-delay-ticks: 5

  # Folder (inside the plugin's data folder) used to store short-lived backups.
  backup-directory: rollback
